# Intro
At the time of writing the HHKB 25th anniversary keyboard is not supported by the remapping tool. We simply need to add the model name, as it shares the same hardware with the other hybrid models (KB800 for US and KB820 for JP)

# How to use
Replace your KeyboardDatalist.json with the provided file, or copy over the `PD-KB800YS` entry.

# Compatibility
Only the US layout is supported/provided, I do not have a JP model to test. 
The following info is provided without any guarantee: for the JP model I assume you have to change `layoutType` and `firmTypeNumber` aside from the model numbers
