# Intro
At the time of writing the HHKB 25th anniversary keyboard is not supported by the remapping tool due to a simple JSON entry, as it is a simple "reskin" of the hybrid models

# How to use
Replace your KeyboardDatalist.json with the provided file, or copy over the `PD-KB800YS` entry.

# Compatibility
Only the US layout is supported/provided, I do not have a JP model to test. 
The following info is provided without any guarantee: for the JP model I assume you have to change `layoutType` and `firmTypeNumber` aside from the model numbers
